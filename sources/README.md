# fetiche-sources

This is the main crate implementing the site-specific ways of accessing, authenticating and fetching data from the
supported sources. Currently, we support:

- Aeroscope
- ASD
- Opensky
- Avionix Cube (WIP)
- Thales Senhive (WIP)
- Safesky (incomplete)

## Sources

A source can support one or more operation like `Fetch` and `Stream`. At this moment, only Opensky support streaming.

### Aeroscope

This is the data extracted from a local Aeroscope antenna, considering you are supposed to have a local server attached
to the antenna. Software supplied by DJI store data in its [MongoDB] database and there is a local API to access said
data. Our antenna was supplied by [ASD] and interestingly enough the data model and access methods are not exactly the
same.

### ASD

This source is for data aggregated by [ASD] on the `airspacedrones.com` through their own API. The data model & API are
different from the local access in the previous one because you can have multiple antennas from a single API endpoint.

### Avionix Cube

Avionix has developed a drone surveillance system with their own antenna, supporting only [RemoteID] as wire protocol.  
Many DJI drones already implement RemoteID so it will be interesting to see how different the traffic is when using
Remote ID information only. The data feed is accessible through a server-based API or directly from the antenna. The
former has either poll-based calls or a TCP streaming fee, whereas the antenna only has TCP streaming.

Avionix Cube sends both ADS-B and RemoteID data.

### Thales Senhive

Thales has its own drone surveillance system as well, called Senhive. This is yet another way to fetch the data, as
they are using [AMQP] and its topic-based architecture. We will be using [Lapin] as our main AMQP client library, see
[this example](examples/senhive-amqp.rs) for details.

### Opensky

Opensky is different from the previous two sources as it is an ADS-B data site, not a drone-specific one. We use Opensky
for sites that do not have access to our own set of ADS-B antennas (called EMIT). The API is radically different from
more common sources like Flightradar24 or Flightaware. You have access to only the last hour of data through the API and
you must use their SSH-based Impala shell for "historical" datasets.

I am currently cheating there by repeatedly calling the API (there are no API limitation for data generated by you own
antennas) and generating a stream from this. I have included a caching system to avoid sending the data several times
as the API can (and will) send you the same dataset sometimes.

### Safesky

Safesky is an alternate ADS-B source we thought we'd be working with at some point so partial support is there but has
not been tested. See the [source](src/access/safesky.rs). This is under the feature `safesky`.

### Flightaware

Flightaware Hose ADS-B data feed is now supported as well, although we do not have an account for now.

This is under the feature `flightaware`"

## Configuration

I use an [HCL] file called `sources.hcl`  to store the source parameters. You are not really supposed to edit this and
that's why it is not documented in `acutectl`. It also contains the credentials for the various access points.

On UNIX systems, it is located in `$HOME/.config/drone-utils/sources.hcl` and in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\DRONE-UTILS` on
Windows.

The current config file version is 4. This is where all the URL for the parts of each API are defined, which routes are
available, the default data model etc.

<summary>sources.hcl</summary>

```hcl
version = 4

site "local" {
  features = ["fetch"]
  type     = "drone"
  format   = "aeroscope"
  base_url = "http://127.0.0.1:2400"
  routes = {
    get = "/drone/get"
  }
}

site "big.site.aero" {
  features = ["fetch"]
  type     = "drone"
  format   = "asd"
  base_url = "https://api.site.aero"
  routes = {
    get = "/api/journeys/filteredlocations/json"
  }
}

site "opensky" {
  features = ["fetch", "stream"]
  type     = "adsb"
  format   = "opensky"
  base_url = "https://opensky-network.org/api"
  routes = {
    get = "/states/own"
  }
}

site "safesky" {
  features = ["fetch"]
  type     = "adsb"
  format   = "safesky"
  base_url = "https://public-api.safesky.app"
  routes = {
    get = "/v1/beacons"
  }
}
```
