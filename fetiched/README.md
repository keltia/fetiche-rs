# fetiched

This is the daemon component of the Fetiche framework.  It will be using the various components of Fetile like the
engine and sources to implement a client-server approach.

It is not supposed to be called directly but it should be triggered by any call to `acutectl` or similar CLI utility when
it sees the daemon is not running.
