# fetiche-client

This is the stub library part of the engine. It is the front end that all applications use.

## Variants

There are two variants of this library:

- local

This instantiates the `Engine` class directly.

- gRPC

This one uses gRPC to communicate to the `Engine` class on a remote server.
